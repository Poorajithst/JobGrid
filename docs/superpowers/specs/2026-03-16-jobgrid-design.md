## Database Schema

All timestamps stored as ISO text strings (SQLite-friendly, Postgres-portable). Drizzle generates SQL migrations from schema definitions.

|---|---|---|
| id | integer, PK, auto-increment | |
| name | text, not null | Display name |
| greenhouse_slug | text, nullable | For boards-api.greenhouse.io |
| lever_slug | text, nullable | For api.lever.co |
| active | integer (boolean), default 1 | Pause without deleting |
| last_checked | text, nullable | ISO timestamp of last successful API call |
| created_at | text, default now | |

### jobs

Core table. All discovered jobs from all sources.

| Column | Type | Notes |

| error | text, nullable | Error message if failed |

## Sources Layer

### Orchestrator (sources/index.ts)

Runs all 5 sources in sequence: API sources first (fast, zero risk), then Playwright scrapers. Deduplicates and returns only net-new jobs.

**Execution order:**
1. Greenhouse API + Lever API (parallel via Promise.all)
2. Indeed scraper (sequential — one browser page at a time)
3. Google Jobs scraper
4. ZipRecruiter scraper

**Applicant filtering:** After collecting results, jobs with `applicants > MAX_APPLICANTS` are dropped. If `applicants` is null (common for Greenhouse/Lever APIs which don't expose counts, and some scraped listings), the job passes the filter — only skip when we have a count and it exceeds the threshold.

**Deduplication:**
1. Deduplicate within batch by `link` (exact URL match)
2. For ATS sources (Greenhouse and Lever only), also deduplicate by `(source, ats_id)` to catch URL variations. Scraped sources (Indeed, Google Jobs, ZipRecruiter) do not populate `ats_id` — they rely solely on `link` for dedup.
3. Query existing `jobs` table for matching `link` values
4. Insert only truly new jobs, return them for scoring

**Error handling:** Each source wrapped in try/catch. Partial failures don't block other sources. `scrape_runs` logs which sources succeeded with status `partial` if some failed, `failed` only if all did.

### Greenhouse (sources/greenhouse.ts)

Pure API — no browser. Iterates companies with `greenhouse_slug` set.

```
GET https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs
```

Maps: `job.title` → title, `job.location.name` → location, `job.absolute_url` → link, `String(job.id)` → ats_id, `job.updated_at` → posted_at.

### Lever (sources/lever.ts)

Pure API — no browser. Iterates companies with `lever_slug` set.

```
GET https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json
```

Maps: `job.text` → title, `job.categories.location` → location, `job.hostedUrl` → link, `job.id` → ats_id, `new Date(job.createdAt).toISOString()` → posted_at.

### Indeed (sources/indeed.ts)

Playwright scraper. Navigates to Indeed with query params:
- `q=project+manager`
- `l=Worcester,MA`
- `radius=25`
- `fromage=1` (last 24h)
- `sort=date`

Waits for `.job_seen_beacon`, extracts title/company/location/link/posted_at from cards. Scrapes first page only (with `fromage=1` and 25mi radius, first page is sufficient for daily runs). All scraper selectors (Indeed, Google Jobs, ZipRecruiter) are fragile by nature — if a scraper returns 0 results, log a warning indicating possible selector breakage.

### Google Jobs (sources/google-jobs.ts)

Playwright scraper. Runs multiple search queries defined in a `SEARCH_QUERIES` constant (not driven by env vars — Google Jobs queries need manual tuning unlike Indeed's structured params):
- "project manager" Worcester MA
- "program manager" Worcester MA
- "technical program manager" Boston MA
- "infrastructure PM" remote

Navigates to `google.com/search?q={query}&ibp=htl;jobs`. Waits for the jobs carousel to render (`.PwjeAc` cards). Extracts from each card:
- Title: `.BjJfJf` innerText
- Company: `.vNEEBe` innerText
- Location: `.Qk80Jf` innerText
- Link: first `a[href]` in the card
- Maps to common job shape with `source: 'google-jobs'`, `ats_id: null`

Note: Google Jobs selectors are fragile and may change. If selectors break, the scraper will return 0 results and log a warning — it won't crash the run.

Note: `SCRAPE_RADIUS` and `DAYS_POSTED` env vars apply to Indeed and ZipRecruiter (which accept structured query params). Google Jobs queries are static strings because Google's jobs carousel does not support radius/date params in the URL — filtering happens visually in the carousel UI.

### ZipRecruiter (sources/ziprecruiter.ts)

Playwright scraper. Navigates to ZipRecruiter with query params:
- Search URL: `https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs-search?search=project+manager&location=Worcester%2C+MA&radius=25&days=1`
- Waits for `.job_listing` cards
- Extracts from each card: title (`.job_title`), company (`.company_name`), location (`.location`), link (`a.job_link[href]`), posted_at (`.posted_date`)
- Maps to common job shape with `source: 'ziprecruiter'`
- Applies same delay patterns as other scrapers (2-5s between actions)

### Browser Infrastructure (browser/)

- **instance.ts** — Singleton Playwright browser manager. Launches Chromium with realistic viewport (1920x1080), standard user-agent. Provides `getPage()` and `close()`.
- **delay.ts** — Random delays between 2–5 seconds between page actions to mimic human browsing patterns.

### Companies (sources/companies.ts)

Typed array of target companies, seeded with initial list. Managed at runtime via `/api/companies` endpoints.

Initial seed companies (verified slugs):
- MathWorks (greenhouse: mathworks)
- Infosys BPM (greenhouse: infosysbpm)
- Abiomed (greenhouse: abiomed)
- HubSpot (greenhouse: hubspot)
- Wayfair (greenhouse: wayfair)
- Toast (greenhouse: toast)
- Klaviyo (greenhouse: klaviyo)
- Rapid7 (greenhouse: rapid7)
- Moderna (greenhouse: moderna)
- Vanderhoof & Assoc (lever: vanderhoof)
- Datto (greenhouse: datto)
- Allegro MicroSystems (greenhouse: allegromicrosystems)
- Insulet Corporation (greenhouse: insulet)

Additional companies can be added at runtime via POST /api/companies.

## Groq Scoring Layer

### Profile (scorer/profile.ts)

Typed constant containing the PM profile:
- Role: Project Manager at WPI
- Experience: Multi-million dollar infrastructure/security portfolio, AI camera systems (Milestone VMS, AI Argus), emergency phone systems, parking gates, electronic access control, MGHPCC data center, executive reporting
- Certifications: CAPM, PMI-ACP, SAFe
- Skills: Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Platform, Agile, Scrum
- Previous: RELI Group — PM Analyst, cybersecurity, ISO 27001
- Location: Worcester MA, open to remote

### Scoring Prompt (scorer/prompts.ts)

Instructs LLaMA 3.3 to analyze job against profile. Returns JSON:

```json
{
  "fit_score": 0-100,
  "competition": "low | medium | high",
  "recommendation": "apply | watch | skip",
  "score_reason": "one sentence",
  "pitch": "two sentence outreach hook"
}
```

Temperature 0.2 for consistency. Groq SDK supports `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` for LLaMA 3.3 models. Zod validates the response shape as a safety net. If Groq changes support, fallback is prompt-based JSON enforcement + JSON.parse with error retry.

### Outreach Prompt (scorer/prompts.ts)

On-demand prompt for generating full outreach drafts. Takes job + type (connection/email/inmail) + pitch as seed. Used by `/api/outreach/:id`.

### Batch Scorer (scorer/index.ts + groq.ts)

- Batches of 10 jobs
- Each batch scored in parallel via `Promise.all`
- 1-second pause between batches (Groq rate limits). On 429 responses, retry with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, max 3 retries per job).
- Failed individual scores logged and skipped (don't block batch)
- Updates `jobs` table with fit_score, competition, recommendation, pitch, score_reason

## API Layer

Express.js on port 3001. All routes prefixed `/api`. CORS enabled for Vite dev server.

### Endpoints

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /api/jobs | List jobs. Query: `?source=greenhouse&status=discovered&competition=low&minScore=70&search=manager&sort=fit_score&order=desc&page=1&limit=20`. Response: `{ jobs: Job[], total: number, page: number, totalPages: number, hasMore: boolean }` |
| GET | /api/jobs/:id | Single job with full detail + outreach drafts |
| PATCH | /api/jobs/:id/status | Update pipeline status. Body: `{ status, applied_at?, interview_at?, offer_at? }`. Auto-sets timestamps. |
| PATCH | /api/jobs/:id/notes | Update notes/next_action. Body: `{ notes?, next_action? }` |
| POST | /api/outreach/:id | Generate outreach via Groq. Body: `{ type: "connection" | "email" | "inmail" }`. Saves to outreach table. |
| GET | /api/stats | Dashboard aggregates: total, avg fit, low-competition count, by-source, by-status, last scraped, new today |
| POST | /api/scrape | Trigger full source run async. Runs as a detached Promise in-process. A concurrency guard (simple boolean flag) prevents overlapping runs — returns `409 Conflict` if a run is already in progress. Returns `{ runId }`. |
| GET | /api/scrape/:runId | Get status of a specific scrape run. Frontend polls this every 3 seconds after triggering a manual run, stops when status is no longer `running`. |
| GET | /api/scrape/log | Last 10 scrape runs |
| GET | /api/companies | List target companies |
| POST | /api/companies | Add company. Body: `{ name, greenhouse_slug?, lever_slug? }` |
| PATCH | /api/companies/:id | Update company (toggle active, change slugs) |
| DELETE | /api/companies/:id | Remove company |

### Stats Response Shape

```json
{
  "total": 47,
  "avg_fit": 81,
  "low_competition": 18,
  "by_source": {
    "greenhouse": 18,
    "lever": 12,
    "indeed": 10,
    "google-jobs": 7,
    "ziprecruiter": 0
  },
  "by_status": {
    "discovered": 22,
    "applied": 14,
    "interview": 6,
    "offer": 1,
    "rejected": 4
  },
  "last_scraped": "2026-03-16T02:00:00Z",
  "new_today": 8
}
```

### Validation

Zod schemas on all mutation endpoints. Schemas are defined in the backend package (`src/api/schemas.ts`) and imported by the frontend via pnpm workspace dependency (`@jobgrid/backend/schemas`). This avoids a separate shared package while keeping types in sync.

### Error Handling

Centralized error middleware returns consistent `{ error: string, details?: any }` with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Scheduler

node-cron at `0 2 * * *` (2am daily). Runs in the same process as Express.

**Sequence:**
1. Create `scrape_runs` entry (started_at, status running)
2. API sources in parallel: `fetchGreenhouse()` + `fetchLever()`
3. Launch Playwright browser
4. Run scrapers sequentially: Indeed → Google Jobs → ZipRecruiter
5. Close browser
6. Deduplicate and insert new jobs
7. Score new jobs via Groq
8. Update `scrape_runs` with finished_at, jobs_found, jobs_new, sources_run, final status

## Frontend

### UI Design

Dark analytics aesthetic (Linear/Vercel-inspired):
- Deep dark background (#080b14, #0a0f1e, #0f172a)
- Gradient logo, ambient glow effects
- Score circles with radial gradients and color-coded glow (80-100 indigo, 60-79 amber, 0-59 red)
- Frosted stat badges with colored borders
- Card hover animations (lift + slide)
- Active card with left-edge accent bar and subtle box glow
- Gradient pipeline bar
- Top-glow accent lines on metric cards
- Custom scrollbars, Inter font family

### Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| TopBar.tsx | Logo, stat badges (total/avg fit/low comp/new today), last scraped time, Run Now button |
| JobList.tsx | Filter pills (source/pipeline/competition), search input, scrollable job card list |
| JobCard.tsx | Title, company, location, score circle, competition/recommendation/source tags, posted time, applicant count |
| DetailPanel.tsx | Job header, 4 metric cards, score reason, outreach pitch, description preview with expand, pipeline bar, action buttons, notes |
| Pipeline.tsx | Clickable segmented bar: Discovered → Applied → Interview → Offer. Separate "Reject" button below the bar (rejection can happen from any stage, not just linearly). Sets status to `rejected` and records which stage the rejection came from in `notes`. |
| OutreachModal.tsx | Draft display with copy-to-clipboard, outreach history |
| StatusBar.tsx | (Integrated into TopBar) Last scraped, source counts, manual trigger |

### Hooks & Data Flow

- **useJobs(filters)** — Fetches `/api/jobs` with reactive query params. Returns `{ jobs, loading, error, refetch, hasMore, loadMore }`. Debounced search (300ms).
- **useStats()** — Fetches `/api/stats`. Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds. Refetches after manual scrape.
- **useJob(id)** — Fetches `/api/jobs/:id` for detail panel. Includes outreach history.
- **Optimistic updates** on pipeline status changes and notes. Revert on error.
- **Axios client** with base URL from `VITE_API_URL`, response interceptor for errors.

### Score Badge Colors

| Range | Color | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 80-100 | Indigo | #6366f1 / #a5b4fc |
| 60-79 | Amber | #f59e0b / #fcd34d |
| 0-59 | Red | #ef4444 / #fca5a5 |

### Source Tag Colors

| Source | Color |
|---|---|
| Greenhouse | Cyan (#22d3ee) |
| Lever | Amber (#fbbf24) |
| Indeed | Red (#f87171) |
| Google Jobs | Purple (#c084fc) |
| ZipRecruiter | Green (#34d399) |

## Build Order

Each step is independently testable before the next depends on it.

1. **Project scaffolding** — pnpm workspace, tsconfigs, package.jsons, Drizzle config, Tailwind + shadcn/ui init
2. **Database schema** — Drizzle schema definitions, generate initial migration, run migration
3. **Company seed** — Seed 10-15 companies with known Greenhouse/Lever slugs
4. **Greenhouse + Lever fetchers** — Test against real APIs, validate JSON parsing and mapping
5. **Groq scorer** — Profile, prompts, batch scorer with hardcoded test job, validate JSON output
6. **Indeed scraper** — Playwright setup, browser manager, delay util, Indeed scraper
7. **Google Jobs + ZipRecruiter scrapers** — Remaining Playwright scrapers
8. **Source orchestrator** — Combine all sources, dedup logic, scrape_runs logging
9. **Express API** — All endpoints, Zod validation, error middleware, CORS
10. **React frontend** — Vite + shadcn/ui setup, dark theme, all components with mock data
11. **Wire frontend to API** — Replace mocks with Axios calls, hooks, optimistic updates
12. **Cron scheduler** — node-cron wired to orchestrator + scorer
13. **End-to-end test** — One full manual run, verify complete pipeline
